# Advanced-Optimization-Based-Robot-Control

## A1 
The goal of the assignment is to implement different types of controllers, in particular:
- Operational Space Controller
- Impedance Controller

For the Operational Space Control (OSC), we are interested in testing the control applied to a postural task, which means we want to stabilize the position of the end-effector at a given point and then to a reference trajectory.

As for the Impedance Control (IC), the assignment asks us to compare different formulations (simplified and complete versions) and apply them to a postural task which will be, again, the stabilization at a given point for the end-effector and after we want to stabilize the end-effector around a given trajectory.
